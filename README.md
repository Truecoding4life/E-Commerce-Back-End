### Description 
My back-end application empowers e-commerce operations within the electronics industry, streamlining online transactions for electronic products. In 2021, the U.S. e-commerce sector reached a substantial $2.54 trillion in revenue. As the use of a database is vital in every industry, my back-end application excels at managing this essential aspect with efficiency and precision. I was able to edit, update, delete, read, or create new data in the database, enhancing its functionality and utility.
